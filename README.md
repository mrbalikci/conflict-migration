## Topic and Focus
Every year, hundreds of thousands of individuals flee their countries as refugees. We will be creating and interactive visualization showing where these refugees flee from, the country they settle in, the armed conflicts potentially sparking these migrations, and the potential impact to the countries receiving these individuals.

## Data Sources
We will be focusing on data 1990 - present.
